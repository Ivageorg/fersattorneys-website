<!-- HISTORY + FOUNDER’S MESSAGE -->
<section id="history" class="fade-in">
  <h2>Founder’s Message & Company History</h2>
  <p>
    Fers Attorneys was born out of a profound commitment to transform the legal 
    landscape during one of the most challenging periods in recent history—the 
    COVID-19 pandemic. As the global crisis forced widespread office closures and 
    disrupted traditional legal service delivery, it exposed significant gaps in 
    accessibility and efficiency. Witnessing the struggles faced by clients and legal 
    professionals alike, our founder, <strong>Ferdinard Nwobodo</strong>, a seasoned 
    corporate and litigation lawyer with extensive international credentials, was 
    inspired to create a law firm that could bridge these gaps and redefine the future 
    of legal practice.
  </p>
  <p>
    Armed with an LLB from Birmingham City University, UK, and certification in Fraud 
    Investigation Management from Coventry University, Ferdinard brought a unique 
    blend of global insight and local expertise to the table. Drawing on his 
    experiences working with renowned law firms and his passion for innovation, he 
    envisioned a modern, technology-driven legal practice designed to transcend 
    traditional constraints to provide seamless, high-quality legal services.
  </p>
  <p>
    From virtual consultations to streamlined case management, the firm was built to 
    ensure that clients could access expert counsel without disruption, regardless of 
    their location or the complexity of their needs. This founding principle of 
    resilience and innovation continues to drive us today. It shapes our approach to 
    legal practice, guiding our commitment to excellence, flexibility, and 
    client-focused service delivery.
  </p>
  <p>
    At Fers Attorneys, we are not just responding to the challenges of a changing 
    world—we are redefining how legal services are delivered for generations to come.
